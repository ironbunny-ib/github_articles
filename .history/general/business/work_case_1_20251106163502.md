# A case of work
 
## Work is happening.
+ A base, dismal but simple arrangement of what happens in an organization.
+ There are many roles with departments with managers
+ There are multi-department managers who oversee everything
+ Work happens in windows of time - hours for an individual, years for strategy, daily for progress
 
The idea is to see the organization as composed of windows of time and individual roles that exist.
Work happens to be a function of these two in this simple arrangement.
 
The cornerstone of analysis is the reality of work when there is no event happening
> ***Select individual roles, imagine their work over different windows of time, imagine more people***

In this reality one gets to be mindful of everybody in the organization. It's an ability to be able to see so distinctly. Over it you imagine all kinds of time windows, all kinds of top down instructilia, all kinds of events, all good and bad problems as they appear cyclically. Over this you place the organization, what it does, why it does that, how it does it. Over that you figure out names of leaders and then managers and then specialists and then individual contributors.  

It should dawn on you how each individual is planning and conducting their work, how they are affected by leadership strategy, what one thinks of when they feel achievement in multiple time windows. Then you move to managers, their responsibilities, their blind spots, their insights. How they measure performance and how you measure them.

Then you think of the work one is doing, how many types of work there are, how many strategic thoughts are in play, the way the organization is inter-playing these. At the top most you think of leadership team realities (which I talk about somewhere else).
