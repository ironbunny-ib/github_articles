# A case of work

## Work is happening.
+ A base, dismal but simple arrangement of what happens in an organization.
+ There are many roles with departments with managers
+ There are multi-department managers who oversee everything
+ Work happens in windows of time - hours for an individual, years for strategy, daily for progress

The idea is to see the organization as composed of windows of time and individual roles that exist.
Work happens to be a function of these two in this simple arrangement.

The cornerstone of analysis
### Select individual roles, imagine their work over different windows of time
