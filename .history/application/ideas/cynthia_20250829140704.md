# Aha happened
The idea was born of a simple motivation, what if ideas could be collected from all employees in an org? Wouldn't it be mega useful?
# Problems were being created
There was no problem identified. New problems were being thought of from the solution that was being imagined. 
# Selling was being devised
The product was simple, the idea was to create content and girth in selling, that we were coming from an extremely thoughtful situation.
# Targeting was being focused
Failure to communicate led to simplifying the sales motion. The web was still being used to display content.
# Product was being enhanced
Failure to sell was being converted into more problems being faked.
# No demand was found
Extensive and naive attempts were made to send emails, run ads. Nothing was hitting. All kinds of segmentation was done, a lot of email content eg. multi level drip, multi send reminder etc. were pondered and tested from a gmail account.
# The product was not made
But it was getting complex, with the thought that a simple product wasn't valuable.
# Content was thought
Blog content, across the funnel was ideated and re ideated and still more was done. Many premises were written.
# Features were christened
A enviable amount of nuanced features given the thought up problems were knitted. It was sensible and on theme.
# Communication always failed
And thus the response was changing something, not being good enough, more to learn, begin again.
