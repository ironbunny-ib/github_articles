# Cohort Analysis

### Cohort Element
Cohort analyses have three components: the cohort grouping, a time series of data over which the cohort is observed, and an aggregate metric that measures an action done by cohort members.

### Problem Theories
+ **Retention** - A widely used measure to aggregate findings about the population where they remain customers
+ **CLTV** - One measure that differentiates segments within the population so to treat them independently
