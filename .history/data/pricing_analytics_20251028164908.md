## Notes from Erik Haugom's --> Essential of Pricing Analytics

### Introduction
+ Pricing analytics is all about transforming data of some sort into insight for making better pricing decisions. Pricing analytics is usually concerned with the short- term.
+ Because of the very rapidly changing conditions in most markets, pricing analytics can be considered a continuous process where new information must be incorporated in the analysis as soon as it arrives.
+ The pricing process must be carried out for each element of the pricing cube and the analysis may also consider restrictions or dependencies occurring between the various elements.
