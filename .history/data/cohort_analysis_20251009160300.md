# Cohort Analysis

### Cohort Element
Cohort analyses have three components: the cohort grouping, a time series of data over which the cohort is observed, and an aggregate metric that measures an action done by cohort members.

### Problem Theories
+ **Retention** - A widely used measure to aggregate findings about the population where they remain customers
+ **CLTV** - One measure that differentiates segments within the population so to treat them independently

#### Areas to analyze
+ **Once representatives take office, how long do they keep their jobs?**
+ Data is really good at answering such broad indeterminate questions

#### Understanding the Legislators Data
+ Analysis is shown first, to understand the context, refer to sections on the end.




#### Understanding the Legislators Data

Congress has two chambers, the Senate (“sen” in the data set) and the House of Representatives (“rep”). Each state has two senators, and they are elected for six-year terms. Representatives are allocated to states based on population; each representative has a district that they alone represent. Representatives are elected for two-year terms. Actual terms in either chamber can be shorter in the event that the legislator dies or is elected or appointed to a higher office. Legislators accumulate power and influence via leadership positions the longer they are in office, and thus standing for re-election is common. Finally, a legislator may belong to a political party, or they may be an “independent.” In the modern era, the vast majority of legislators are Democrats or Republicans, and the rivalry between the two parties is well known. Legislators occasionally change parties while in office.
