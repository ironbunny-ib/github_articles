### A focus is on behavioural analysis 

Behaviours are caused by motivations, both primary and experiential. Behaviours are purchases, visits, product usage and penetration, opens, clicks and marcom responses, etc. These behaviours cause financial results, revenue, growth, lifetime value and margin.


### The advantage of behavioral segmentation

One critical difference between BS and RFM is that in a behavioural segmentation members typically do not change groups. That is, the behaviour that defines a segment evolves very slowly. This means the characteristics used to define segments stay with the customer for life or long periods.

## Customer Segmentation: Beyond Behavioral Segmentation

### Predictive Segmentation

Has become increasingly sophisticated. Rather than just looking at past behavior, companies now use machine learning to predict future customer value, churn risk, or lifetime value. This lets you proactively segment customers based on what they're likely to do rather than what they've done.

### Intent-Based Segmentation

Gaining traction, especially with the rise of first-party data and advanced analytics. This focuses on identifying signals of customer intent—what problem they're trying to solve, what they're actively researching, or what stage they're at in their buyer's journey. It's more about understanding why customers act than just how they act.

### Contextual/Situational Segmentation

Recognizes that customer behavior varies by context. A customer might behave differently on mobile vs. desktop, during a crisis vs. normal times, or at different times of the year. This approach segments based on the situation they're in rather than treating them as a static profile.

### Psychographic + Behavioral Fusion

Combines psychological traits, values, and attitudes with behavioral data. Tools for this have improved significantly, making it easier to understand not just what customers do, but who they are and what drives their decisions.

### Zero-Party Data Segmentation

Emerging as privacy regulations tighten. Rather than inferring preferences, companies ask customers directly through surveys, preferences centers, or interactive experiences, then segment based on explicit preferences and stated needs.

### AI-Driven Dynamic Segmentation

Uses continuous learning models to automatically adjust segments in real-time as customer behavior evolves, rather than static quarterly or annual resets.

### Overall Trend

The movement is toward more **predictive, intent-driven, and dynamic** approaches that adapt to changing customer contexts and regulations.
