# Data Value Chain
![Data Value Chain](../logistics/data_value_chain.png)

The diagrams below are related to others in a comparison of sorts, where you can distinguish how this task is different from the rest. They are not meant to be deep dives into individual specific depth one might face when doing them. Rather, these are management's territory or for teams to deal with management. We are sometimes unaware of what general need is creating undistinguishable work. Once we know that what task requires which type of orientation, we can envision them to be done right.

This opens up conversations, helps in excelling in any of those you are responsible for, and be aware of the general field in which anybody might operate in. This is not a complete list though, and I would update it as I learn more.


## Model Building
One of the popular task in analysis is modeling solutions to problems. This diagram tries to depict some of the generic steps that might be involved in that process.

## Incoming Request
Another task is to do analysis that is not theoretical, and comes up as requests from practical needs. This diagram tries to depict some of the generic steps that might be involved in that process.

## Department Work
A lot of departments have dedicated analytics teams. And this work might be documented in house, and may also be available as theory outside the organization (in articles, research papers, subject matter).

## Independent work
This is work that is based on general business levers. These are based on characteristics of the general business, and our task is to apply it to our specific business. This work can be done independently from other data work, and must be super valuable if performed and shared regularly.

**Independent Work can be Seen in:**
+ Direct Reasoning (Observable to a Fresh Mind)
+ Data Vision by Experienced Eyes
    + Data Mastery
    + Domain Mastery
+ AI Prompting
+ Research: Delving into Hard Thinking
    + Goal Led
    + Curiosity Led

Opportunities for Independent Work will emerge given the context of an organization, and the origins of the industry.
