### A focus is on behavioural analysis 

Behaviours are caused by motivations, both primary and experiential. Behaviours are purchases, visits, product usage and penetration, opens, clicks and marcom responses, etc. These behaviours cause financial results, revenue, growth, lifetime value and margin.

One critical difference between BS and RFM is that in a behavioural segmentation members typically do not change groups. That is, the behaviour that defines a segment evolves very slowly. This means the characteristics used to define segments stay with the customer for life or long periods.
