## Notes from Erik Haugom's --> Essential of Pricing Analytics

### Introduction
+ Pricing analytics is all about transforming data of some sort into insight for making better pricing decisions. Pricing analytics is usually concerned with the short- term.
+ Because of the very rapidly changing conditions in most markets, pricing analytics can be considered a continuous process where new information must be incorporated in the analysis as soon as it arrives.
+ The pricing process must be carried out for each element of the pricing cube and the analysis may also consider restrictions or dependencies occurring between the various elements.

### Economics of Pricing analytics
+ A market basket could refer to the quantities of food, electronics, movie theater tickets and other goods and services that a consumer buys each week, month, or year
+ The consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the maximum amount a given consumer is willing to pay for the good or service, and the price.
+ The optimal price is found exactly where the MR equals the MC when each price change effects the whole inventory being sold

### Segmentation and Price Differentiation
+ To be able to charge different prices for identical or very similar products, the firm must segment the market based on certain criteria
+ **A starting point** for selecting such criteria could be the PRO cube. The three dimensions in this PRO cube are customer type, product and channel.
