# Cohort Analysis

### Cohort Element
Cohort analyses have three components: the cohort grouping, a time series of data over which the cohort is observed, and an aggregate metric that measures an action done by cohort members.

### Problem Theories
+ **Retention** - A widely used measure to aggregate findings about the population where they remain customers
+ **CLTV** - One measure that differentiates segments within the population so to treat them independently

#### Areas to analyze
+ **Once representatives take office, how long do they keep their jobs?**
+ Data is really good at answering such broad indeterminate questions

#### Understanding the Legislators Data
+ Analysis is shown first, to understand the context, refer to sections on the end.




#### Understanding the Legislators Data

Congress has two chambers, the Senate (“sen” in the data set) and the House of Representatives (“rep”). Each state has two senators, and they are elected for six-year terms. Representatives are allocated to states based on population; each representative has a district that they alone represent. Representatives are elected for two-year terms. Actual terms in either chamber can be shorter in the event that the legislator dies or is elected or appointed to a higher office. Legislators accumulate power and influence via leadership positions the longer they are in office, and thus standing for re-election is common. Finally, a legislator may belong to a political party, or they may be an “independent.” In the modern era, the vast majority of legislators are Democrats or Republicans, and the rivalry between the two parties is well known. Legislators occasionally change parties while in office.

For the analyses, we’ll make use of two tables: legislators and legislators_terms. The legislators table contains a list of all the people included in the data set, with birthday, gender, and a set of ID fields that can be used to look up the person in other data sets. The legislators_terms table contains a record for each term in office for each legislator, with start and end date, and other attributes such as chamber and party. The id_bioguide field is used as the unique identifier of a legislator and appears in each table.
